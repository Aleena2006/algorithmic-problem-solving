# Algorithmic Problem Solving (Python)

This repository contains structured solutions to core algorithmic
problems commonly asked in software engineering internship interviews.

Focus Areas:
- Arrays and two-pointer techniques
- Hashing and frequency-based problems
- Sliding window patterns
- Stack-based logic

Each solution emphasizes clean logic,
edge case handling, and time complexity awareness.
